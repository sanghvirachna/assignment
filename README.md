# 🧾 Invoice Management

This application is a simple invoice management system built with Node.js and PostgreSQL. It provides features to create a new invoice, retrieve an invoice including customer and items, update invoice status from pending to paid and vice versa, list invoices for a customer including total amount and status for each invoice, and calculate total sales for a customer.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

## 🚀 Setup

1. **Create PostgreSQL Database** 🗄️

    First, you need to create a PostgreSQL database. You can do this through the PostgreSQL command line or a GUI like pgAdmin.

2. **Create Tables** 📚

    You will need to create three tables: `customers`, `invoices`, and `invoice_items`. Here are some basic commands to create these tables:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE customers (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100)
    );

    CREATE TABLE invoices (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
      status VARCHAR(50),
      total DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );

    CREATE TABLE invoice_items (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      invoice_id INTEGER REFERENCES invoices(id),
      item_name VARCHAR(100),
      quantity INTEGER,
      price DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
    ```

    These commands create the tables with the necessary columns. Adjust the data types and constraints according to your requirements.

3. **Install Dependencies** 📥

    Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Application** 🖥️

    You can start the application with the following command:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    OR
   
     ```bash
   npm run dev
    ```
    The application will start and listen on port 3000.

## 🛠️ Usage

You can use a tool like curl, Postman, or Thunder Client to send HTTP requests to the application. Here are the available endpoints:

- `POST /invoices`: Create a new invoice.
- `GET /invoices/:id`: Retrieve an invoice including customer and items.
- `PUT /invoices/:id/status`: Update invoice status from pending to paid and vice versa.
- `GET /customers/:id/invoices`: List invoices for a customer including total amount and status for each invoice.
- `GET /customers/:id/total_sales`: Calculate total sales for a customer.

Please replace `:id` with the actual ID of the invoice or customer.

## 🧪 Testing

The application includes a suite of tests built with Jest and Supertest. These tests cover the main functionalities of the application and ensure that everything is working as expected.

To run the tests, first, make sure you have Jest and Supertest installed. If not, you can add them with `npm install --save-dev jest supertest`. Then, you can run the tests with `npm test`.

Remember to replace `:id` with the actual ID of the invoice or customer when making requests. Enjoy coding! 😊
